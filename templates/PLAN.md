# Execution Plan — Phase {{PHASE_NUMBER}}: {{PHASE_NAME}}

<!--
  Execution plan for a single phase.
  Generated by the planner agent after research is complete.
  Reviewed during the discuss phase. Locked before execution begins.
  Changes after lock require re-planning (gmsd replan).
-->

---

## Phase Goal

{{PHASE_GOAL}}

<!--
  One sentence. What does "done" look like for this phase?
  This drives verification — everything is measured against this goal.
  Example: "Users can sign up, log in, and reset their password via email."
-->

---

## Context

<!--
  Key references that informed this plan.
  Planner should read these before generating tasks.
-->

- **Research**: See [RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md) — {{RESEARCH_SUMMARY}}
- **Decisions**: See [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md) — {{DECISIONS_SUMMARY}}
- **Roadmap**: See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) — Phase {{PHASE_NUMBER}} of Milestone {{MILESTONE_NUMBER}}
- **Design**: {{DESIGN_REFERENCE}}

---

## Tasks

<!--
  Numbered task list. Each task is an atomic unit of work assigned to one executor.

  Complexity: trivial | low | medium | high
  Dependencies: "none" or comma-separated task numbers within this phase

  IMPORTANT: Tasks must be ordered so that dependencies are satisfied top-down.
  An executor should be able to pick up any task whose dependencies are marked done.
-->

<!--
  Add more tasks as needed. Copy the task template block above.
  Typical phase has 3-10 tasks depending on complexity.
-->

## Verification Spec

<!--
  How to verify the PHASE GOAL was achieved — NOT individual tasks.
  Verification is goal-backward: start from the goal, derive what must be true.
  The verifier agent uses this spec to run checks after execution.
-->

### Goal Decomposition

The phase goal "{{PHASE_GOAL}}" is achieved when:

1. {{VERIFICATION_CRITERION_1}}
2. {{VERIFICATION_CRITERION_2}}
3. {{VERIFICATION_CRITERION_3}}

### Verification Steps

1. {{VERIFICATION_STEP_1}}
2. {{VERIFICATION_STEP_2}}
3. {{VERIFICATION_STEP_3}}

### Automated Checks

```
{{VERIFICATION_COMMANDS}}
```

<!--
  Shell commands or test commands that can verify correctness.
  Example:
  npm test -- --testPathPattern="auth"
  curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health | jq .status
-->

---

## Risk Assessment

<!--
  What could go wrong during execution? How do we mitigate?
  Focus on risks specific to THIS phase, not general project risks.
-->

| Risk                        | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                        |
|-----------------------------|------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| {{RISK_1_NAME}}             | {{RISK_1_LIKELIHOOD}} | {{RISK_1_IMPACT}} | {{RISK_1_MITIGATION}} |
| {{RISK_2_NAME}}             | {{RISK_2_LIKELIHOOD}} | {{RISK_2_IMPACT}} | {{RISK_2_MITIGATION}} |
| {{RISK_3_NAME}}             | {{RISK_3_LIKELIHOOD}} | {{RISK_3_IMPACT}} | {{RISK_3_MITIGATION}} |

---

## File Ownership

<!--
  Maps files/directories to task groups to prevent merge conflicts.
  During parallel execution, no two executors should touch the same file.
  If overlap is unavoidable, mark it and the team lead will serialize those tasks.
-->

| File / Directory             | Owned By Task(s) | Shared | Notes                    |
|------------------------------|-------------------|--------|--------------------------|
| {{FILE_1}}                   | {{FILE_1_OWNER}}  | no     | {{FILE_1_NOTES}}         |
| {{FILE_2}}                   | {{FILE_2_OWNER}}  | no     | {{FILE_2_NOTES}}         |
| {{FILE_3}}                   | {{FILE_3_OWNER}}  | yes    | {{FILE_3_NOTES}}         |

<!--
  Shared files require sequential execution of the tasks that touch them.
  The team lead must coordinate access to shared files.
-->
