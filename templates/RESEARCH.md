# Research — Phase {{PHASE_NUMBER}}: {{PHASE_NAME}}

<!--
  Research output generated by researcher agents before planning.
  This document informs the planner and is referenced from PLAN.md.
  Generated during the "research" sub-phase of each phase.
-->

---

## Research Goal

{{RESEARCH_GOAL}}

<!--
  What did we need to learn before we could plan this phase?
  Example: "Understand Supabase Row Level Security patterns for multi-tenant auth,
  evaluate Stripe subscription API for tiered pricing, and determine optimal
  Next.js middleware approach for auth guards."
-->

---

## Findings

<!--
  Organized by topic. Each finding should be independently useful.
  Researchers should include enough detail that the planner doesn't need
  to re-research the same topic.
-->

## Technical Decisions

<!--
  Decisions made based on research findings.
  These become constraints for the planner.
  Each decision should reference the finding that supports it.
-->

## Risks Discovered

<!--
  Things uncovered during research that could affect implementation.
  These feed into the Risk Assessment section of PLAN.md.
-->

| Risk                              | Severity   | Affects              | Suggested Mitigation              |
|-----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| {{RISK_1}}                        | {{RISK_1_SEVERITY}} | {{RISK_1_AFFECTS}} | {{RISK_1_MITIGATION}}          |
| {{RISK_2}}                        | {{RISK_2_SEVERITY}} | {{RISK_2_AFFECTS}} | {{RISK_2_MITIGATION}}          |
