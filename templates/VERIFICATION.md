# Verification Report — Phase {{PHASE_NUMBER}}: {{PHASE_NAME}}

<!--
  Verification report generated by the verifier agent after execution completes.
  Uses goal-backward analysis: starts from the phase goal and checks if it was met.
  This document determines whether the phase can proceed or needs gap fixes.
-->

---

## Phase Goal

{{PHASE_GOAL}}

<!--
  Restated from PLAN.md. This is the single measure of success.
-->

---

## Verification Method

<!--
  How was verification performed? Goal-backward means:
  1. Start from the phase goal
  2. Decompose into observable criteria
  3. Check each criterion against the actual codebase
  4. Report pass/fail with evidence
-->

**Approach:** {{VERIFICATION_APPROACH}}

<!--
  Example: "Manual code review of all modified files, automated test execution,
  and end-to-end flow testing of the signup/login/reset password flows."

## Results

<!--
  Each criterion maps to a decomposition of the phase goal.
  Status: pass | fail | partial
  Evidence: specific file, test output, or observation that supports the status.
-->

| #  | Criterion                          | Status  | Evidence                              |
|----|------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| 1  | {{CRITERION_1}}                    | {{STATUS_1}} | {{EVIDENCE_1}}                   |
| 2  | {{CRITERION_2}}                    | {{STATUS_2}} | {{EVIDENCE_2}}                   |

## Gaps Found

<!--
  Issues that prevent the phase goal from being fully met.
  Each gap should be specific and actionable.
  Severity: critical (blocks next phase) | major (degrades quality) | minor (cosmetic/nice-to-have)
-->

### Gap 1 — {{GAP_1_TITLE}}

| Field        | Value                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Severity     | {{GAP_1_SEVERITY}}                 |
| Criterion    | {{GAP_1_CRITERION}}                |
| Description  | {{GAP_1_DESCRIPTION}}              |
| Suggested Fix| {{GAP_1_FIX}}                      |

### Gap 2 — {{GAP_2_TITLE}}

|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Severity     | {{GAP_2_SEVERITY}}                 |

### Gap 3 — {{GAP_3_TITLE}}

| Field        | Value                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Severity     | {{GAP_3_SEVERITY}}                 |
| Criterion    | {{GAP_3_CRITERION}}                |
| Description  | {{GAP_3_DESCRIPTION}}              |
| Suggested Fix| {{GAP_3_FIX}}                      |

<!--
  Add more gaps as needed. If no gaps found, replace this section with:
  > No gaps found. All criteria passed.

## Gap Tasks

<!--
  New tasks created to close the gaps above.
  These are appended to the phase's PLAN.md and assigned to executors.
  Only created for critical and major gaps. Minor gaps are logged but not blocked on.
-->

| Task # | Gap # | Description                        | Complexity | Files to Touch       |
|--------|-------|------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| {{GAP_TASK_1_NUM}} | {{GAP_TASK_1_GAP}} | {{GAP_TASK_1_DESC}} | {{GAP_TASK_1_COMPLEXITY}} | {{GAP_TASK_1_FILES}} |
| {{GAP_TASK_2_NUM}} | {{GAP_TASK_2_GAP}} | {{GAP_TASK_2_DESC}} | {{GAP_TASK_2_COMPLEXITY}} | {{GAP_TASK_2_FILES}} |

<!--
  If no gap tasks needed:
  > No gap tasks required. All criteria met.
-->

## Recommendation

<!--
  Final recommendation from the verifier.
  Options:
    - PROCEED — All criteria met. Move to next phase.
    - FIX_GAPS — Critical/major gaps found. Execute gap tasks, then re-verify.
    - REPLAN — Fundamental issues found. Phase needs re-planning.
-->

**Recommendation:** {{RECOMMENDATION}}

**Rationale:** {{RECOMMENDATION_RATIONALE}}

<!--
  Example:
  Recommendation: FIX_GAPS
  Rationale: "2 of 5 criteria partially met. Password reset flow sends email but
  the reset token has no expiration. One gap task created to add token TTL.
  After fix, re-verify criterion #4."
